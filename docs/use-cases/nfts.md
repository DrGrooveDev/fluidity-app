# ðŸ–¼ NFTs

NFT marketplaces facilitate significant value transfer and commerce. Fluidity can provide an incentive to purchase or sell NFTs, by rewarding yield when users pay or sell for Fluid Assets.

Both parties receive yield, including the marketplace, causing positive feedback loops and incentives for all parties in a transaction to utilise Fluid Assets.

Even fractionalisation and interacting with NFTs in different protocols can generate a yield generating event, allowing for users to more fluidly transact and trade their assets accordingly.
