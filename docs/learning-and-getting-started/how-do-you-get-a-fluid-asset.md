# ðŸŒŸ How do you get a Fluid Asset?

To mint a Fluid asset, you can go to the [Fluidity Webapp](https://fluidity.money) and swap a supported principal token for a Fluid counterpart. Initially, we will be supporting stablecoins but any asset can be wrapped into a Fluid Asset, as long it has a Money Market with sufficient liquidity available.&#x20;

**For example, converting 1 USDC will allow you to mint 1 Æ’USDC.**

**You can always redeem 1 Æ’USDC back for 1 USDC coin at any time.**

As the project matures, you will be able to get Fluid assets from multiple sources, such as AMMs or DEXs like (Uniswap, Sushiswap, 0x), NFT marketplaces, and practically any other application where you would be exchanging assets.
