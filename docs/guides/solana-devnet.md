#### _Please read the fully detailed **Fluidity Devnet release** article for a step by step guide on how to get the most out of our beta_ [_here_](https://blog.fluidity.money/fluidity-solana-devnet-beta-is-live-751918993eb0)__
{% endhint %}

When using the [**Fluidity web app**](https://app.solana.beta.fluidity.money/) ([https://app.solana.beta.fluidity.money/](https://app.solana.beta.fluidity.money/)) for the first time you need to make sure you are using the Solana Devnet test network and have the following:

* A Solana compatible wallet (Sollet, Phantom, SolFlare, etc.) to interface with the Beta.
* Have funded your wallet with Devnet SOL.
* Have funded your wallet with Solana Devnet ƒUSDC.
* Other users or wallet addresses to send your fluid assets to and receive from.

Within this beta, you will be able to interact with a myriad of utilities that you should expect to see in the final version of the Fluidity protocol, however, there are certain features that are not in the current version of the beta, including things such as interactions that have dependencies on the FLUID governance token as well as the correspondent heightened reward probability that a user has by holding said token.



**You will be able to:**

* Swap base assets for fluid assets and vice-versa _(such as between USDC to ƒUSDC)._
* Follow the Reward Pool as it increases, and Prize Board winners in the dashboard as the rewards get distributed to the various Fluiders participating in the beta.
* Have an overview of your account balance.
* Send and Receive fluid assets.
* Visualize your send and transaction history.
* Interact with the[ Fluidity Faucet](http://faucet.fluidity.money/) ([http://faucet.fluidity.money/](http://faucet.fluidity.money/))
* Swap Fluid assets on (Devnet) Uniswap.
* **Get (Devnet) rewarded for sending and receiving Fluid Assets!**

We recommend that you follow the guide below to have the best experience and be able to provide the best possible feedback so that we are able to continually improve your interaction with the Fluidity protocol and its applications!
