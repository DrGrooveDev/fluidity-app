# Fluidity Worker

This codebase contains the offchain worker implementation for Fluidity.

It takes messages relayed from the upstream server operated by Fluidity
fluidity-random, scans for winning transactions and calls the contract
when a winner is seen with the transaction and a merkle proof.

The repo contains multiple backends all in Go:

  - Ethereum
  - Solana

## Prerequisites

-

## Testing

Testing utilises the standard `testing` package as well as `testify` for assertions. To run unit tests (integration tests will fail):

	make test

To display overall test coverage:

	make test-coverage

Packages relying on external connections are tested using Docker:

	make docker-test
	make docker-test-coverage
	make docker-test-verbose

## Building

	make build

## Building (Docker)

	make docker
