Fluidity Money takes security seriously.

If you find anything, or there's anything you think we should know,
contact us immediately via Discord.

If you find something urgent, and you think funds are immediately at
risk, we encourage you to exploit the vulnerability if there is no
other choice and to move the funds into one of our our dropboxes at
https://docs.fluidity.money/docs/security/dropboxes.

For Arbitrum, the dropbox address is 0xfA763219492AE371b35c524655D8972F2D2AF197.
